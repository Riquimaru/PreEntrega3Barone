                    </div>
                    <p>Saki is a shy and bookish girl with a poor sense of direction. At first, despite her skills, she
                      doesn't like mahjong, in particular because of her family. She is very caring about her friends'
                      feelings, as seen when she loses on purpose to Yuuki Kataoka to make her feel better and stops
                      doing so because Nodoka says that she cannot have fun if Saki is holding back. Saki gets very
                      excited when thinking about playing against strong competition.

                      Saki is a poor swimmer and she doesn't use electronics, only getting Mako's old cell-phone right
                      before the team semi-finals in the nationals.</p>

                    <p>Nodoka's personality is a "proper lady" as noted by Mako Someya where she is very logical but can
                      be a bit childish as she cannot sleep without her penguin doll. She is distant with Saki at first
                      but over time becomes extremely close to her. Nodoka is also very stubborn and despite being
                      logical rushes into things without thinking. She is sensitive when talking about her breasts with
                      others.

                    </div>
                    <p>Despite being a first year in high school, Yuuki is a very child-like girl who seems to be
                      obsessed with Nodoka Haramura's large breasts and wants larger ones herself. She is flirtatious
                      towards Kyoutarou Suga; whether this is because of an actual attraction or because she likes to
                      poke fun is unknown. She is also protective of her friends: during the nationals when the media
                      says that the Nagano prefecture has been dropping in power, she gets angry because she feels that
                      they are making fun of her friends and she vows to make them pay.

                      She is also quite prideful, as Nodoka noted that she wouldn't let herself cry in front of other
                      first-years, but was willing to cry when only Mako Someya and Hisa Takei were in the room.</p>

                    <div data-aos="flip-right">

                    </div>
                    <p>Hisa is shown to be a great leader both while playing mahjong and outside of it. Hisa is very
                      caring for her underclassmen like when she comforts Yuuki Kataoka after her defeat in the
                      prefectural tournament. She has good foresight and can be very scheming, with people noticing that
                      Yuuki's shift in playstyle during the semifinals was an intentional play by someone else who had
                      something bigger than winning the semifinals in mind.

                      She is shown to have great confidence in her mahjong ability and will not back down from a
                      challenge. However, she did waver during the national tournament's second round but recovered soon
                      after. Opponents have described her as having bad manners due to her slamming of the tiles during
                      matches.

                    <p>Mako is a reliable person and a trusting friend, being the only person that Hisa Takei shows her
                      doubts to. She is often snarky when she speaks to Hisa. She was very close to her grandpa growing
                      up and has adopted some of his personality, like the way he speaks. She uses the dialect from
                      Hiroshima prefecture because of his influence.

                      However, she is also shown to be a bit vengeful, as she, along with Tomoki Sawamura and Miharu
                      Yoshitome, sought revenge against Kaori Senoo for defeating them in the prefectural final with her
                      beginner's luck.

                      breasts. She also seems to be very optimistic, as she waited for two years for someone to restart
                      the mahjong club. She has a very good relationship with her older sister. Kuro has described
                      herself as the waiting type. However, it is hinted that she is also a little oblivious, as she was
                      unable to tell that Kirame Hanada and Toki Onjouji helped her win off of Teru Miyanaga.

                      Kuro describes herself as a "waiting-type," as she cleaned the Achiga mahjong room when it was her
                      turn after the club has disbanded and is willing to wait for dora to come back to her, even if
                      she's unsure if they would.

                    <p>Yuu is polite, shy, and a bit of a push-over. However, she can be determined at times, refusing
                      to buckle even when faced with unfavorable situations, and being determined to win back any points
                      her sister lost.She has a strong relationship with her sister, and has been friends with Ako
                      Atarashi and Arata Sagimori for some time.

                      Yuu's biggest quirk is that she is very sensitive to the cold so much so that she freezes even
                      during the summer and so always wears mittens, scarves, and other items to keep her warm.</p>

                    <p>According to Harue Akado, Ako is a cunning individual and she is much like Shizuno Takakamo in
                      that she is cheerful but more logical compared to Shizuno. Ako showed her ambition and forethought
                      when she transferred away from Achiga to pursue mahjong at Adamine, but later showed her loyalty
                      by returning to Achiga to play mahjong with her friends. She also wants to hang out with her
                      friends as much as possible and have fun playing mahjong with them like in the past. She is not
                      afraid to be blunt (telling Kuro Matsumi that it was her fault for losing 40,000 points in the
                      quarterfinals) but also comforts her friends when necessary (following up by saying that they just
                      had to win back those points).

                      Despite her upfront and confident bravado, she revealed to Yuu that she was scared before playing
                      in the semifinals, who comforted her accordingly.

                      and quit the team afterwards on. But later she starts playing again when Harue becomes the coach
                      of the Achiga team. According to Harue, she is a reliable person, so much so that she is named
                      president of the newly reformed mahjong club.

                        <p>Toki is physically weak that she is constantly being cared for by Ryuuka Shimizudani.
                          Although she cares for Ryuuka and other members, she doesn't want to become a burden to them
                          as she is always being hospitalized.

                          While playing she is very smart and astute (such as how she utilizes her powers), although she
                          also shows a bit of hubris and a defeatist attitude. Against Teru Miyanaga, she attempted to
                          fight the champion head-on, but failed, this lead to her thinking the match was lost and that
                          it was a mistake for Senriyama Girls' High School to put her as their ace. When Kirame Hanada
                          began calling tiles and showing Toki the path to victory, her disposition changed, and she
                          tried her best to help Kirame keep Teru down. Without either player saying anything, they both
                          knew they had the same goal and had to work together in order to get there.

                          Instead of securing second place for Senriyama in order to move onto the finals (such as by
                          allowing Teru to continue her renchan and drop one of the other schools to 0, as Senriyama had
                          a 30,000 point lead on third place Achiga), Toki enabled Kuro Matsumi's baiman win against
                          Teru, prolonging the match and giving the other two schools a chance at moving on that this
                          shows her resolve to get her school to first place.

                        </div>
                        <p>Izumi is shown to have a leadership type of personality despite being a first year. She is
                          headstrong and confident: when she was pushed down, she tried her hardest to get back up and
                          push back. However, she is also conscious of the fact that she let down her teammates by
                          losing over 30, 000 pts, apologising to both Sera Eguchi and Hiroko Funakubo, with tears in
                          her eyes; noting that Sera (Toki Onjouji and Ryuuka Shimizudani) was a third-year and she felt
                          it her fault that they might not continue onto the finals.

                          When she was a child she had a strong personality, concocting a plan to lure Toki and Ryuuka
                          into play mahjong with her. She hated being treated like a child, and looked down on her
                          classmates because she felt she was better than them.

                        <h3>Eguchi, Sera</h3>
                        <div data-aos="flip-left">
                          <img src="../img/info/sera.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Yuuki">
                        </div>
                        <p>Sera is a quite pretty cheerful tomboy and the reason she picked Senriyama's mahjong club is
                          that she wouldn't be forced to wear her school uniform at school, as she is embarrassed to
                          wear a skirt. She is very friendly not only to her friends but also to her opponents as shown
                          when with her interactions with Ako Atarashi, starting out as a friendly rivalry and turning
                          much friendlier after their match (causing Hiroko Funakubo to remark that Sera shouldn't be
                          flirting with their competition).

                          Unlike her team mates who cried at their loss during the Side-A semifinals, Sera did not shed
                          any tears in front of them; although Ryuuka says she didn't eat anything until the day after
                          the Side-B semifinals.</p>

                        <h3>Funakubo, Hiroko</h3>
                        <div data-aos="flip-right">
                          <img src="../img/info/hiroko.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Hisa">
                        </div>
                        <p>Hiroko is the one who informs her teammates about their opponents and how to deal with them.
                          Her teammates compare her to a scientist. She has a growing interest in Arata Sagimori due to
                          her different play style in every game. Thus, she is determined to analyze Arata as her new
                          specimen.

                          Hiroko is typically serious and somewhat blunt, telling Izumi Nijou that there are many in her
                          age group who are much better than she is, and that she should not focus too much on comparing
                          herself to others.

                          Hiroko is in charge of making sure that Sera Eguchi wears her school uniform to matches.

                          Although she was born in Kobe, one cannot distinguish her from a student from Osaka.

                        <div data-aos="flip-left">

                        </div>
                        <p>Ryuuka is a cheerful type girl who shares a strong bond with Toki Onjouji and she always
                          takes care of Toki like a mother and constantly watches over her so that she does not push
                          herself too hard. Since meeting Achiga she seems to have grown fond of them as well to the
                          minutes that she does not know to root for her team or Achiga.

                          Although she can be a bit of an airhead, Ryuuka shows a much more serious and calculated side
                          while playing mahjong. It is said that she tops in Kansai with precise plays and highly
                          accurate predictions, which is reflected when we see glimpses into Ryuuka's thought process at
                          the table.

                          She took her defeat in the semifinals hard, and told Kyouko Suehara that she cried a lot and
                          that sometimes tears would simply fall without any reason.
